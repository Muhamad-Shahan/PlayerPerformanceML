# PlayerPerformanceML
## Project Overview

PlayerPerformanceML is an advanced machine learning project focused on predicting football player performance using a rich dataset of player attributes. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training multiple machine learning models to achieve high prediction accuracy.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features for optimal model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to explore data distributions, relationships between features, and key insights that inform model training.

Model Training
Naive Bayes
Implemented Naive Bayes classifier to establish a baseline performance for comparison with other models.

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Trained SVM to handle high-dimensional data and identify complex patterns in player performance.

Decision Tree
Utilized Decision Tree to model decision rules and visualize feature importance.

Random Forest
Applied Random Forest to improve accuracy and handle overfitting with ensemble learning.

Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Performance results
